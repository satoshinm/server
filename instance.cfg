name=FTB Infinity Evolved 1.7
notes=Infinity Evolved adds game modes!  Two modes are currently included; 'normal' and 'expert'.  New and existing worlds are automatically in 'normal' mode, to switch to the all-new game mode type the following command (without quotes):  "/ftb_mode set expert"  At any time you can return to 'normal' to typing the command: "/ftb_mode set normal"  These same commands can be executed by server ops either in game or from console.  Players joining a server will be switched to the server's game mode upon login automatically.  World resets are not required with the update to 2.0.0 but highly suggested if you are planning to play 'expert' mode due to the massive amount of progression changes.\n<br><br>\nThe pack for all people. Infinity is the general all-purpose pack from the FTB team that is designed for solo play as well as small and medium population servers.\n<br><br>\nThis pack contains <a color="aqua" href="http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=10820">Fastcraft</a>, by Player.  Fastcraft enhances Minecraft with increased performance. Bug reports being made directly to Mod Authors should state Fastcraft is enabled.\n<br><br>
